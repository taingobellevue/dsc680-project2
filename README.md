# Project 2 - Movie Recommendation System

## In this project, a movie recommendation system will be built using machine learning. The data will be processed, explored, visualized and fed into the machine learning models for training, testing and evaluation. The result of the system will allow the users to receive the recommended movies for which they would likely enjoy watching. The project will be done in R.
